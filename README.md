## General Information
This is a university project for Working with Data and code. The intention is to design a piece of code that dmeonstrates my literacy with code, specifically python language. 
Turtle Tales is designed for a 7-10 year old age demographic and is to be ran on a TinkerGen GameGo. 


## Technologies Used
- Python
- MakeCode Arcade


## Features
Key features of this code include
- Main player (Turtle) sprite is able to be controlled with joystick and includes directional animations.
- Diverse enemies (both Crabs and Sharks) that move randomly to create threats to turtle.
- Level design that uses tilemaps to build the world.
- Collision effects that occur when player contacts enemy, includes camera shake and life reduction.
- Sound effects that are triggered by specific moments of game play.

The inclusion of these effects within the game work together to create a fun and interactive game for the players to learn skills of strategy, timing, and fine motor skills. 


## Setup
This repository can be added as an **extension** in MakeCode.

* open [https://arcade.makecode.com/](https://arcade.makecode.com/)


## Project Status
Project is: in progress - paused

There is more work I wish to do to this code, this is not the final product. However, this is the piece I am submitting to my A2 prototype project. 

More can be done after results are returned. 


## Room for Improvement

Room for improvement:
- Ways for players to regain lives through a food element.
- Background music to be playing throughout all gameplay to maintain attention for longer. 

To do:
- Add additional levels to build out further game play.
- More enemies to create harder gameplay.

## Acknowledgements
- This project was inspired by all side scrolling games who paved the way for baby coders to learn and develop skills.
- Special thanks to Evangeline Aguas for her ongoing support and for just being a legend <3
